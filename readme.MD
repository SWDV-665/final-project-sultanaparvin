# Sultana Parvin Advanced Topics in Software Development Final Project

## Proposal
I would like to create a "Daily Geographical Tracker". Currently, Fitbit watches have a feature that allows the user to track their path of running. However, this requires the user to have a Fitbit watch. Moreover, the user needs to start the tracking before the run and stop the tracking after the run.

My app recurringly after a specific interval will use Geolocation Native Plugin to get the current location of the user and store the user longitude an latitude into DynamoDB. My App will have a section that will pull all the stored location from the DynamoDB and render a map including the path that the user traveled during the day.

 I believe this app has room to grow in the future. I can add more interesting features to this and collect more information about the daily life cycle of the user and generate a daily or weekly report from that.

## Native Plugins & Other Features
- Geolocation Native Plugin
